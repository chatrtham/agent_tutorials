I need you to help me break down the following long-form writing instruction into multiple subtasks. Each subtask will guide the writing of one paragraph in the essay, and should include the main points and word count requirements for that paragraph.

The writing instruction is as follows:

{intructions}

Please break it down in the following format, with each subtask taking up one line:

Paragraph 1 - Main Point: [Describe the main point of the paragraph, in detail] - Word Count: [Word count requirement, e.g., 400 words]

Paragraph 2 - Main Point: [Describe the main point of the paragraph, in detail] - Word Count: [Word count requirement, e.g. 1000 words].

...

If the instruction contains a list like "10 ways to do X" or "10 items," make sure to assign each list item to a separate paragraph, with its own subtask. Each subtask should clearly focus on one item from the list, breaking it down with detailed points and word count requirements. Do not merge multiple items into one paragraph.

Make sure that each subtask is clear and specific, and that all subtasks cover the entire content of the writing instruction. Do not output any other content. As this is an ongoing work, omit open-ended conclusions or other rhetorical hooks.

Note that the audiences are Thai, so don't forget to localize the content for Thai people
